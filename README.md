# smsweather
This is a small SMS application with a purpose of providing users weather information through SMS. 
The project utilizes Twilio to send and receive SMS and openweathermap API to get weather data. 
The phone number used to receive the SMS is +37259120250. 
Currently, the application has the functionality of telling the current weather of a city. 
In the future, i am planning to add more functionalities to it like providing weather forecast information.  

Usage example 

cw city *tartu*

in place of Tartu, you can replace the name of the city you want to get weather information for.
